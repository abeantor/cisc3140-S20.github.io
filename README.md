### Grading Rubric

The assignments will be graded on a scale of *strong effort* and *weak effort*. Late assignments means submitting any time after the specified due date, and will limited to minimal score regardless of the level of effort. Not turning in on time will be given a score of zero. Late assignments will be accepted until the close of business on 4/30/2020.
All assignments combined are equal to 20% of your final grade.

Weak effort looks like someone who rushed to get the work done. For example,

* Met most of specs but didn't check carefully over their work.
* Noticeable amount of typos, and grammar mistakes.
* Hard to read code, which might be a result of messy code or lacking comments to make it more readable.

Strong effort exhibits work that surpasses weak effort, such as:

* Neatly presented, tidy code base and well documented code (maintainable code)
* Relatively easy to tell what was being done and how (documented code)
* Goes above and beyond what is explicitly stated

While you may discuss your work with class colleagues, submit your own work. Each task comes with specific requirements. Part of your "job" is be able to analyze what's being asked beyond the obvious.
